The catch block that will execute is:

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

Explanation:

In the line:

int result = arr[3] / 0;

Two errors seem possible:

1. arr[3] → This is invalid because the array has only indices 0, 1, 2.
So this immediately causes an
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.


2. / 0 → Division by zero
(ArithmeticException), but this is never reached because the program already crashed at arr[
